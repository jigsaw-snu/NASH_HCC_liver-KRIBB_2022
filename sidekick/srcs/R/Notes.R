### Overall History and Analysis Goal
#
## We've made a super 'fast-onset' "NASH-driven HCC" mouse model
#
## Ideal model information
#  - HCC_T : NASH(15%) + Fibrosis(15%) + Cancer(70%)
#  - HCC_AT : NASH(47.5%) + Fibrosis(47.5%) + Cancer(5%)
#  - CCl4 : Fibrosis(100%)
#  - NASH : NASH(100%)
#
## Find cancer signal : Control vs HCC_T  ;  HCC_AT vs HCC_T  ;  Rest of all vs HCC_T ?
## Find NASH signal : Control vs NASH  ;  CCl4 vs HCC_AT  ;  (Control + CCl4) vs HCC_AT ?
#
## 1. Confirm if it is certainly a 'NASH-driven HCC' onset model
#     - find cancer signatures
#     - show HCC groups have NASH characteristics
#
## 2. Compare to other existing cancer models (slow-onset models)
#     - common characteristics
#     - differences
#
## 3. If it is confirmed to be a cancer model, compare to Human HCC patients
#     -  




## Quality Control
# QC plots - RLE plot


# QC plots - Sample by Sample Heatmap


# QC plots - PCA & MDS




## Differential Expression Analysis - Normal vs Nash diet (No Cancer, NASH proxy)
# 1. What are the characteristics does NASH group have?  -->  DEG & Pathway analysis
# 2. Does NASH group represents biological signal of NASH?  -->  NASH related pathways?



## Differential Expression Analysis - Normal vs CCl4 treatment (No Cancer, Fibrosis proxy)
# 1. What are the characteristics does CCl4 group have?  -->  DEG & Pathway analysis
# 2. Does CCl4 group represents biological signal of Hepatic Fibrosis?  -->  Fibrosis related pathways



## Differential Expression Analysis - Normal vs HCC (HCC proxy)
# 1. What are the characteristics does HCC group have?
# 2. Does HCC group represents biological signal of Hepatocellular Carcinoma?



## Differential Expression Analysis - NASH vs HCC
# 1. What are the features does HCC group have compared to NASH group?



## Differential Expression Analysis - Fibrosis vs HCC
# 1. What are the features does HCC group have compared to CCl4 group?
